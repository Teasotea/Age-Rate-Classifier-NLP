### Age rate of movies recognition
Dataset with plots of movies from Wikipedia from the years 1915 to 2017: 
https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots 

The task is to create an NLP Model, which will recognize the age rate of movies: 
NC-17, R, PG-13, PG, or G. Hence the project would try to distinguish
whether the film is suitable for a particular age or not
